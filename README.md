# 🖼️ Grizzle

## 📖 Project Description

The website was designed by me in Figma and developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Animations are mostly implemented with CSS (buttons, hover effects, links, slider).
With JavaScript, I created the BLOG, Products, and Solutions pages.
Content is loaded using fetch requests from custom JSON files.
This is a freelance project, published with the client’s permission.
It is not yet launched because the client has not provided final photos and video materials.

## ⚙️  Technologies
- Figma — UI/UX design
- HTML5 — semantic markup, page structure
- CSS3 — styling with flex, position, media queries, responsive layout
- JavaScript — slider logic, fetch requests, interactivity, without libraries
