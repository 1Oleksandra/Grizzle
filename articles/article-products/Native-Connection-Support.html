        Native Connection Support
    </h3>

    <p class="doc-text">
        Native Connection Support is a feature that provides secure and rapid connections to systems directly, without the need for any third-party software or tools. With this feature, users can access systems using their familiar connection methods (such as RDP, SSH, etc.), while the necessary password authentication and security procedures are fully managed by the PAM solution.

       Enabling users to make direct connections increases the speed of operations while minimizing potential security vulnerabilities that may arise during the connection. The automatic handling of password requirements by the PAM system eliminates the need for manual processes, thereby enhancing operational efficiency. Additionally, these direct connections provide an extra layer of security against external threats.

       Native Connection Support allows organizations to maintain flexibility in their business processes while enabling users to securely access systems without changing their daily routines. This way, security measures are strengthened, and business continuity continues uninterrupted.

       Furthermore, this feature simplifies complex connection methods, allowing non-technical users to easily access the system. As a result, access processes are optimized for both technical teams and other users within the organization.
