        Just in-time-limited Privilege (JIT)
    </h3>

    <p class="doc-text">
       Temporary, Time-Limited Privileges provide temporary access rights to dedicated accounts for the duration of a specific task or project, allowing critical functions to be carried out. This approach enables users to gain privileged access only for the necessary duration without the need for permanently high-privilege accounts.
    </p>
    <p class="doc-text">
       Users hold these privileges for a predetermined time period, and their access is automatically revoked once the time expires. This mechanism minimizes privilege escalation and permanent security vulnerabilities by granting access only for the necessary time.
    </p>
    <p class="doc-text">
       Additionally, temporary privileges facilitate monitoring and reporting processes. Each access session is recorded and made traceable, enhancing the organization’s security standards. Implementing time-limited privileges not only increases operational flexibility but also strengthens security protocols, thereby ensuring the protection of systems and data.
