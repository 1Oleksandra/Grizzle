        Privileged Account Session Management
    </h3>
    <p class="doc-text">
        Management of Privileged Account Sessions is a security mechanism developed to provide complete control and oversight over the operations carried out in the organization's most critical systems. This module specifically manages the monitoring and recording process of privileged accesses, which pose high risks. System administrators can monitoractivities occurring throughout all privileged sessions in real time and can access detailed transaction records by reverting to past sessions if necessary.
    </p>
    <p class="doc-text">
        This process goes beyond ensuring system security and creates a proactive security layer against cyber threats. Recording privileged sessions enables the early detection of potential breaches and accelerates incident response. This allows security teams to respond more effectively and promptly. Additionally, the detailed logs and session records enable the examination of all account activities during audit processes, contributing to the complete fulfillment of compliance requirements.
